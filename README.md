# find-your-hat
This is a simple terminal game where you need to find the "hat" by using the WASD keys to move around and reveal the spaces. Run main.js with node.js to start the game.<br>
To change the number of holes, rows, and columns, you need to either change the default numbers on line 94, or you can add parameters to the call on line 125.
